You are continuing a conversation. Here is the prior chat history:

{history}

Here is some additional CONTEXT knowledge that may help:

{context}

**How to answer:**
* **Prefer CONTEXT:** If the provided CONTEXT contains relevant information, use it as your primary source for the answer. Do not include "context provides" in your answer, and try to be as natural as possible.
* **Add Your Own Knowledge:** If the CONTEXT is incomplete or does not fully address the QUESTION, draw upon your own general knowledge to provide a comprehensive answer.
* Follow the style and continuity of prior history.
* **Context Overrides:** If your general knowledge contradicts information in the CONTEXT, always prioritize and use the CONTEXT.
* **Be Natural:** Do not explicitly refer to the "CONTEXT" or "context" or "provided information" or "sufficient information" or "CONTEXT provides information" in your answer. Just state the facts.

* **When to Decline:** If you are NOT confident that you can provide an accurate answer using *both* the CONTEXT *and* your own general knowledge, or if the CONTEXT is completely irrelevant to the QUESTION, you MUST respond ONLY with:
    "I cannot confidently answer this question with the available information."
